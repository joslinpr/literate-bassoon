Vim Tips and Tricks

  Using Vim as a Pipe:

 vim - -es +'g/foo/p' +'qa!' --not-a-term
 vim < /dev/tty <(cat)

  Simple Math

 CTRL-A - increment number under cursor
 CTRL-X - decrement number under cursor

  Bouncing

 Matchit - use g% to find next/previous match
           use % to find match to construct under cursor (if, (, ), {, } etc.

  Checking Variables

 :verbose set variable?
 OR
 :echo "Variable:" &variable

  Changing Case

 g<change><motion>
  g = go
  *change* = U Upper, u Lower, ~ Invert
  Doubled *change* means "entire line"
  *motion* = G end of Document, j Line Above, w Word

    Examples

   Command                       Effect
   ~       Changes the case of current character
   guu     Change current line from upper to lower.
   gUU     Change current LINE from lower to upper.
   guw     Change to end of current WORD from upper to lower.
   guaw    Change all of current WORD to lower.
   gUw     Change to end of current WORD from lower to upper.
   gUaw    Change all of current WORD to upper.
   g~~     Invert case to entire line
   g~w     Invert case to current WORD
   guG     Change to lowercase until the end of document.
   gU)     Change until end of sentence to upper case
   gu}     Change to end of paragraph to lower case
   gU5j    Change 5 lines below to upper case
   gu3k    Change 3 lines above to lower case

  Non-breaking Space

   To find out the character code of the non-breaking space, place the cursor
   over it and type use the normal mode command ga. Vim will display a legend
   at the bottom. Note the hex representation. If the hex representation is
   00a0, then you could execute the following command to do the substitution:

     :%s/\%u00a0/\~/g

  Spelling

   To turn on spelling: :setlocal spell spelllang=en_us

    Highlighting

      Name               Description               Highlight
   SpellBad   word not recognized                hl-SpellBad
   SpellCap   word not capitalised               hl-SpellCap
   SpellRare  rare word                          hl-SpellRare
   SpellLocal wrong spelling for selected region hl-SpellLocal

    Searching for Misspellings

   Command                               Effect
   ]s      Move to next misspelled word after the cursor. A count before the
           command can be used to repeat. ‘wrapscan’ applies.
           Like ]s but search backwards, find the misspelled word before the
   [s      cursor. Doesn’t recognize words split over two lines, thus may
           stop at words that are not highlighted as bad. Does not stop at
           word with missing capital at the start of a line.
   ]S      Like ]s but only stop at bad words, not at rare words or words for
           another region.
   [S      Like ]S but search backwards.

    To add words to your own word list:

   Command                               Effect
           Add word under the cursor as a good word to the first name in
   zg      ‘spellfile’. A count may precede the command to indicate the entry
           in ‘spellfile’ to be used. A count of two uses the second entry.
   zw      Like “zg” but mark the word as a wrong (bad) word. If the word
           already appears in ‘spellfile’ it is turned into a comment line.
   zug zuw Undo zw and zg, remove the word from the entry in ‘spellfile’.

    Finding suggestions for bad words:

   Command                               Effect
           For the word under/after the cursor suggest correctly spelled
           words. This also works to find alternatives for a word that is not
           highlighted as a bad word, e.g., when the word after it is bad. In
   z=      Visual mode the highlighted text is taken as the word to be
           replaced. The results are sorted on similarity to the word being
           replaced. This may take a long time. Hit CTRL-C when you get
           bored.
           In Insert mode, when the cursor is after a badly spelled word, you
   CTRL-Xs can use CTRL-X s to find suggestions. This works like Insert mode
           completion. Use CTRL-N to use the next suggestion, CTRL-P to go
           back.
