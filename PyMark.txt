Installing Markdown (python markdown module and tool)

  Markdown translator, convertor to html

   As root, use pip to install markdown. Root is needed since the command
   line interface is in /usr/local/bin.

 sudo su -
 pip3 install markdown

   There may be a warning about /usr/local/bin not in PATH. Ignore it.
