##      Installing Markdown (python markdown module and tool)
###     Markdown translator, convertor to html

As root, use pip to install markdown.  Root is needed since the command line
interface is in /usr/local/bin.

```
sudo su -
pip3 install markdown
```
There may be a warning about /usr/local/bin not in PATH.  Ignore it.
