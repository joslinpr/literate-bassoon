| **Be Specific**          | "What are the current regulations for shipping lithium batteries to the EU?" | Avoid vague questions like "How do I ship batteries?". Specific questions yield precise answers.                                          |
| **Clearly State Your Goal** | "I need to find a DHL service that offers next-day delivery within Germany." |  Let me know your objective. This helps me focus on the most relevant information.                                                          |
| **Break Down Complex Queries** | Instead of: "Help me with my entire shipment process from origin to delivery." Try:  "What documentation is needed for shipping to Brazil?" then "What are the customs regulations for Brazil?" |  Complex tasks are easier to handle in smaller, manageable parts.                                                                            |
| **Use Keywords**          | "DHL Express tracking number 1Z999AA10123456789"                             | Relevant keywords help me quickly identify and process your request.                                                                         |
| **Specify Data Sources (if needed)** | "What are the latest news articles from reputable sources about DHL's sustainability initiatives?" |  If you have a preference for specific sources, let me know.                                                                                |
| **Clarify Your Context**   | "As a DHL employee, what training resources are available on the Smart Connect intranet for using the new TMS system?" |  Your role and context helps me tailor the response appropriately. Remember I cannot access internal DHL data, so this is crucial.        |
| **Iterative Refinement**   | Ask follow-up questions based on my initial response.                       | My response might not be perfect on the first try.  Iterative questioning helps us reach the best solution.                               |
