## Installing Markdown (python markdown module and tool)

### Markdown translator, convertor to html

As root, use pip to install markdown.  Root is needed since the command line
interface is in /usr/local/bin.

``` bash

sudo su -
pip3 install markdown

```

There may be a warning about /usr/local/bin not in PATH.  Ignore it.
