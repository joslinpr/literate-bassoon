## README.md

### My Book of Knowledge

This is the Book of Knowledge, an unstructed store of miscellaneous things I
need to remember.

### Viewing

Use *glow* to view the Markdown versions, or view the .txt versions.

``` bash

$ glow -s PRJ.json -w $COLUMNS README.md

```

### Conversion

Files without an extension probably need conversion to markdown.

``` bash

$ make -n
$ make
$ make install

```
