##	README.md
###	My Book of Knowledge

This is the Book of Knowledge, an unstructed store of miscellaneous things I
need to remember.

###	Viewing
Use *glow* to view the Markdown versions, or view the .txt versions.

```
$ glow -s PRJ.json -w $COLUMNS README.md
```

###	Conversion
Files without an extension probably need conversion to markdown.
```
$ make -n
$ make
$ make install
```
