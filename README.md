Things I need to document.

# Book of Knowledge

This is the Book of Knowledge, an unstructed store of miscellaneous things I
need to remember.

Files without an extension probably need conversion to markdown.  Use *glow*
to view them, or review the .txt versions.

```
$ glow -s PRJ.json -w $COLUMNS
```
